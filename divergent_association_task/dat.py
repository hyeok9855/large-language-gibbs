Vendored from https://github.com/jayolson/divergent-association-task
(the reference scorer of Olson et al., 2021, PNAS 118(25), used by both
arXiv:2310.11158 and arXiv:2405.13012). The only change is that the default
model/dictionary paths point at divergent_association_task/assets/, populated
by download_assets.sh.
